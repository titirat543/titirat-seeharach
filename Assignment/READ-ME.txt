This folder contains the Java starter code for the CSCU9A2 assignment.

It should be copied to a new folder in your file store, and a new BlueJ
project built in the usual way.

The program is incomplete, although works partially.

Read the long comment at the start carefully - it explains what is to be done.

Detailed assignment instructions will be issued separately.

Good luck!
